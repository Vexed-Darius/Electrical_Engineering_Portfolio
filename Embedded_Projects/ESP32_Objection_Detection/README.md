# ESP32 Object Detection

## Description
Implemented real-time object detection on an ESP32 using an Edge Impulse machine learning model. The system can detect objects and trigger actions based on detection.

## Objective
To deploy a lightweight ML model on an embedded platform for real-time inference and object tracking.

## Tools & Technology
- ESP32 WROVER-KIT
- Edge Impulse
- Arduino IDE / PlatformIO
- C/C++
- Camera module

## Highlights
- Real-time object detection with on-device inference  
- Integrated camera feed and LED/display feedback  
- Learned model deployment, optimization, and embedded ML concepts
