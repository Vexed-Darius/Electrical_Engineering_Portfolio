# ESP32 Object Detection

## Description
Implemented real-time object detection on an ESP32 using an Edge Impulse machine learning model. The system can detect objects and play a sound to alert the driver of distracted driving.

## Objective
To deploy a lightweight ML model on an embedded platform for real-time inference and object tracking.

## Team Project
Completed as part of a group of three students. My responsibilities included:
- Deploying the trained Edge Impulse ML model on the ESP32
- Testing Camera capabilities
- Hardware Design: Powersupply, peripheral componenets and PCB design

## Tools & Technology
- ESP32 WROVER-KIT
- Edge Impulse
- Arduino IDE / PlatformIO
- C/C++
- Camera module

## Highlights
- Real-time object detection with on-device inference  
- Integrated camera feed and audio feedback 
- Learned model deployment, optimization, and embedded ML concepts
